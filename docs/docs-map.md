- [`frontend.md`](./frontend.md): Web UI architecture, key components, and validation behaviour.
- [`backend.md`](./backend.md): FastAPI endpoints, synthesis service plumbing, and metadata flow.
- [`testing.md`](./testing.md): Pytest organisation, Playwright end-to-end checks, and recommended quick commands.
- [`deployment.md`](./deployment.md): Docker, Cloud Run, and Vercel deployment tips plus required environment variables.
- [`privacy.md`](./privacy.md): High-level guidance on epsilon/delta, rho-CDP, and how each synthesiser consumes the budget.
- [`media/`](./media): Sequence diagrams and flow charts used by the README.
- [`sample_output/`](./sample_output): Example synthetic CSV and evaluation metrics to preview the final artefacts.
