# Documentation Overview

This folder complements the main repository README with deeper dives into the UI, backend services, and testing strategy. Use the quick links below to jump to the topic you need:

- [`frontend.md`](./frontend.md): Web UI architecture, key components, and validation behaviour.
- [`backend.md`](./backend.md): FastAPI endpoints, synthesis service plumbing, and metadata flow.
- [`testing.md`](./testing.md): Pytest organisation, Playwright end-to-end checks, and recommended quick commands.
- [`media/`](./media): Sequence diagrams and flow charts used by the README.

Want to add more detail? Create a new Markdown file under `docs/` and cross-link it here and in the main README.
